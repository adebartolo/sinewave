Sine waves represent pure tones.

They are important because they can analyze complex sounds (Fourier Analysis).

Sine waves describe:
- the distance an object moves from rest
- the regular back & forth motion of an object over time
- the vibration, simple harmonic motion, compression & rarefaction of air molecules as a sound travels through air
